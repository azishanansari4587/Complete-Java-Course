        //! Ques: What is Java?
        //* Ans: Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language. It is developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.

        //? ðŸš€ Features of Java
        //*    âœ… Platform-independent (Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)
        //*    âœ… Object-Oriented (Follows OOP principles)
        //*    âœ… Secure (Runs inside JVM, avoids direct memory access)
        //*    âœ… Multi-threaded (Supports concurrent execution)
        //*    âœ… Robust & Memory Managed (Automatic Garbage Collection)

        //! Ques: What is the difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK?
        //* Ans: JVM: Java Virtual Machine, It Converts bytecode to machine code and executes the code.
        //*      JRE: Java Runtime Environment, It provides the Java platform and includes the JVM.
        //*      JDK: Java Development Kit, It includes the JRE and development tools.

        //* TODO: JDK = JRE + JVM + Compiler + Debugger

        System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!"); //* Prints text to the console.
